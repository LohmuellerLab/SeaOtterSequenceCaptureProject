Isolation.Contraction.Migration: The two populations have a fixed current size, and these population sizes are each allowed to change sizes 35 generations in the past. At this point, a constant migration rate that is inferred begins between the two populations. At an inferred time T generations in the past, these two populations merge into an ancestral population


Isolation.Contraction: This is the same as the Isolation.Contraction.Migration model, with the only difference being no migration being introduced. 


Isolation.Migration: Two population sizes are inferred, along with a constant migration rate between the two populations. At some point T generations in the past (which is inferred), the two populations merge into one ancestral population. 


Isolation: The same as the Isolation.Migration model, only with no migration between the two populations.
