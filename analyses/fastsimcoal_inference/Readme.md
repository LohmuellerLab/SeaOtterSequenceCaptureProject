Single population inference for California (CA), Aleutian Islands (AL), Alaska (AK), Commander Islands (COM), and Kuril Islands (KUR) can be found in the 1D_inference folder. 

The two dimensional inference for California and Alaska (neutral.CA.AK) are found in the 2D_inference folder.

All of the site frequency spectra for the above models are found in the folder SFSes_final

Submitter scripts for both the one and two dimensional models are also provided in the corresponding 1D and 2D directories, which allow fastsimcoal to run multiple replicates in parallel

Note that you have to sed in the correct sample size for each population -- replacing the SAMPLE_SIZE variable (done in the wrapper)
